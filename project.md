					<h3>Appliances Energy Prediction</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters). The attribute information can be seen below.</p>

					<h3>The stability of grid systems prediction</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Electrical grids require a balance between electricity supply and demand in order to be stable. Conventional systems achieve this balance through demand-driven electricity production. For future grids with a high share of inflexible (i.e., renewable) energy sources, the concept of demand response is a promising solution. This implies changes in electricity consumption in relation to electricity price changes. In this work, we’ll build a binary classification model to predict if a grid is stable or unstable using the UCI Electrical Grid Stability Simulated dataset.</p>

					<h3>Predicting the career longevity of NBA players</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America. The league comprises 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. [source of information: Wikipedia] Using machine learning techniques determine if a player’s career will flourish or not. For any athlete in any sport,  career length is determined by a variety of factors. Factors such as games played, game count, and other data of the player during the game.</p>

					<h3>Electricity Price Time Series Forecast</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Electricity consumption is cyclical, varying by months, days of the week and hours. For this reason, a wide range of research deals with the inclusion of seasonal patterns in electricity price forecasts.</p>
